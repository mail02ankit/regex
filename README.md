# Regular expression and Pandas
In the project, I use regular expressions to extract dates, months and years from a medical dataset. 


## Note
I use bitbucket for the version control as It provides free private repositories. If you want to get full development-history for this code, please email me on mail02ankit@gmail.com.

If you use this code, send me a pizza at mail02ankit@gmail.com
